## Problem Description
In the developed markets, all commercial and industrial consumers buy the electricity well before they consume it. It is bought through well negotiated and mutually agreed contracts between producer/supplier and consumer. The process is called hedging. This insures companies against the risk of daily price volatility. Therefore, price forecasting is critical to both producers and consumers in the competitive electric power markets.

## Model Used
The fluctuations of electricity, like other commodities, is effected by many micro and macro economic factors. It is very difficult and expensive to model the price fluctuations using these factors. But the historical time series data captures many (though not all) of these factors inherently and it is inexpensive to use this information to predict prices. Many time series techniques like Simple extrapolation, Auto Regression, Moving Average, ARIMA, etc., can be used to forecasting.

ARIMA stands for auto-regressive integrated moving average and is a type of time series forecasting technique. It is used extensively in forecasting consumptions and prices of commodities (Fuel, Electricity, Share prices, etc.,)

## Outcome
Using ARIMA model we are able to forecast future prices.
